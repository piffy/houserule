%h3 Deactivation

%p
  Deactivation is quite a drastic operation, which can have a strong impact on the program. Therefore we offer you two alternatives:

= form_for(@user,:method => :delete )  do |f|
  %div{:class =>"row well"}
    %div{:class =>"span8"}
      %p
        = radio_button_tag 'delete_style', "destroy", true, :class=>"checkbox"
        %b
          Destroy
        %br
        Using this method, user
        = "''"+@user.name+"''"
        will be completelu removed from the system, leaving no trace. At the same time, all of his events, groups, etc.
        will also be removed.

      %p
        = radio_button_tag 'delete_style', "deactivate", false, :disabled => true
        %b
          Deactivate
        %i (Option not yet implemented)
        %br
        Using this method, user
        = "''"+@user.name+"''"
        will be deactivated and won't be able to logon, be invited or give feedbacks. Preferences, events and
        feedbacks will still be on the system and can be viewed. The user can be easily reactivated.


  = f.submit "Elimina", :class=>"btn btn-danger",  :confirm => 'Sei sicuro? Non si pu√≤ tornare indietro!'
